Food Delivery Web Application

Project Description

This Food Delivery Web Application allows users to explore a variety of food items categorized by type, select their desired meals, and seamlessly manage their orders through a user-friendly interface. The project offers essential features such as user authentication, an interactive menu, and a shopping cart for food item management.

Key Features:

Home Section: Welcoming landing page providing an overview of the platform.
Menu Section: Displays a variety of food items categorized by types (e.g., appetizers, main courses, beverages, desserts).
Cart Section: 
1) Add, remove, and manage selected food items.
2) Real-time updates of the cart.
3) Display total price based on selected food items.

Authentication:

Secure login and sign-up functionality.
Personalized user experience.

Setup Instructions:

Back-end Setup

1) Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Food_Delivery/backend

2) Install dependencies:

npm install

3) Set up environment variables by creating a .env file in the backend directory:

MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
PORT=4000

4) Start the back-end server:

   npm run start

The back-end server will run at http://localhost:4000.

Front-end Setup

1) Navigate to the front-end folder:

cd ../frontend

2) Install dependencies:

npm install

3) Start the front-end server:

npm start
The front-end server will run at http://localhost:3000.

API Endpoints

1) GET /api/food: Fetch all food items.

2) POST /api/food/add: Add a new food item (protected route requiring proper body and image upload).

Assumptions, Challenges, and Limitations

Assumptions:

1) The menu items are stored and managed through a MongoDB database.

2) A secure environment is configured using environment variables.

Challenges:

1) Ensuring smooth integration of the front-end and back-end components.
2) Handling image uploads for food items using multer.
3) Managing state for cart functionality dynamically with real-time updates.

Limitations:

1) No payment gateway integration at this stage.
2) Limited to basic authentication features (OAuth support is not yet implemented).

Future Improvements:

1) Integration with a payment gateway.
2) Enhanced security measures, such as password encryption and OAuth.
3) Improved UI/UX for better customer engagement.

Conclusion

This Food Delivery Web Application provides an essential and scalable solution for online food ordering. With seamless integration and a dynamic user experience, it serves as a strong foundation for further enhancements and growth.
